## 🧾 **1️⃣ One-Page Report Summary**

### **💡 Title:**

**AI for SDG 3: Predicting Disease Outbreak Risk Using K-Means Clustering**

---

### **🌍 SDG Problem Addressed:**

This project supports **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being**.
Many developing regions face recurring outbreaks of **vector-borne diseases** such as *malaria* 🦟 and *dengue* 🩸.
By predicting potential **outbreak risk zones** using AI 🤖, governments can plan early interventions and allocate medical resources more effectively.

---

### **🧠 Machine Learning Approach:**

We applied **Unsupervised Learning — K-Means Clustering** to group regions based on:

* 🌡️ **Average temperature**
* 🌧️ **Precipitation levels**
* 🧍‍♀️ **Population density**
* 🦟 **Malaria & dengue case counts**

This clustering revealed **four distinct risk categories**, showing disease vulnerability patterns **without prior labels**.

---

### **📊 Results:**

* **Silhouette Score:** ~**0.55** → Indicates good cluster separation ✅
* **PCA Visualization:** Clear cluster boundaries — climate 🌦️ and population 👥 factors strongly influence disease spread.

**Cluster Interpretation:**

* 🟥 **Cluster 0:** High temperature + high disease cases → **High-Risk Zones** ⚠️
* 🟧 **Cluster 1:** Moderate climate + moderate cases → **Medium-Risk Zones**
* 🟩 **Cluster 2:** Cooler regions + few cases → **Low-Risk Zones** 🌿

These insights guide **targeted prevention**, **resource allocation**, and **public-health monitoring**.

---

### **🤝 Ethical Reflection:**

* ⚖️ **Data Bias:** Under-reported data may cause unfair risk labeling.
* 🔍 **Fairness:** Open-source datasets (Kaggle, WHO, UN) ensure transparency and inclusiveness.
* 🧑‍⚕️ **Accountability:** The model supports — not replaces — human experts.
* 🌱 **Sustainability:** Early detection optimizes resources and prevents crises.

By ensuring **continuous data updates** and **human oversight**, this project promotes **fair, transparent, and sustainable AI** for global health 🌐❤️.
